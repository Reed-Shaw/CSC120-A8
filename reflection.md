- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Okay so the game was supposed to be a puzzle where you walk around a limited space and you have to get a key that lets you open a box that reveals wings inside and whatever you put in to the fly method allows you to win the game. 
I added methods like getInventory so the player could see what they had in their inventory.
I started this assignment late becuase I was so swamped by other classes and the final project for this class that I didn't have enough time in my day to work on it. I ended up with not enough time to finish so the only thing I was able to confidently get running from the contract was the walk method. Something that was helpful was that Tillie used some of her work from this assignment on this project so having that in the building blocks of our project is probably what got me this far to begin with. I guess I'm not great at making something without structure.
If I were to do this again I guess I would find extra time somewhere? Frankly I wasn't willing to kill myself over an assignment I knew could be dropped from the gradebook if I ended up with an awful score. 
I'd advise someone taking this class in the future to plan out a good amount of time for this assignment ot make sure they can complete it. I'd also tell them to keep it simple. I definately tried to do more than I had time for here.
